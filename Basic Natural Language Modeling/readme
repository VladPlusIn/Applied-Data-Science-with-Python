Document Similarity & Topic Modelling
Overview
This repository contains code for two main tasks: Document Similarity and Topic Modelling. 

Frameworks Used
NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) for tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and WordNet integration.

Gensim for Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling in this assignment.

scikit-learn for calculating the accuracy score in the label_accuracy function.

Tasks and Functions
Document Similarity
doc_to_synsets: Tokenizes and tags words in documents, finds corresponding synsets using WordNet.
similarity_score: Computes normalized similarity score between lists of synsets.
document_path_similarity: Calculates the symmetrical path similarity between documents.
Topic Modelling
LDA Modelling: Utilizes Gensim's LDA model to extract topics from newsgroup_data.
Topic Distribution: Predicts topic distribution for a new document using the trained LDA model.

The dataset used in this project includes the following files:

train.csv: Training set containing blight ticket information issued between 2004 and 2011.
test.csv: Test set containing blight ticket information issued between 2012 and 2016.
addresses.csv and latlons.csv: Files mapping ticket IDs to addresses and addresses to latitude/longitude coordinates.
